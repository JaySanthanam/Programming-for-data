I want to make a comment on the method I followed to do the financial difficulties correlation to average scores. The method I followed is that if on free/reduced lunch the lunch takes on a value 0 which is lower than the one I assigned to standard lunch (which is 1). So if the average score is greater for those in standard lunch, that means that there is positive correlation with not facing financial difficulties. Hope this makes sense. This is a very crude way (I feel) of doing the correlation. I chose to use 0 and 1 since there are only 2 possibilities, either facing fianncial difficulties or not. I could do the same for preparing for the course as well. "

        "Naturally, we can draw conclusions based on the above statistics. There are more males than females (but not significantly different). In reading and writing females (on an average) score better than males. In maths males score better on an average than females. In maths, reading and writing the highest scores are the same between males and females( 100%). However, the lowest scores are worse among male than female in all 3 subjects. Of course, I can make more inferences if I look at percentiles etc. But I will stop here."

Group C has highest number of parents with just high school education. We had already seen that group C students scored the lowest in all 3 subjects (although this doesn't prove causal) and parental education has significant impact of pupil's scores. This again reinforces that conclusion. Group E pupils continue to score highest in all 3 subjects regardless of parental education compared to other students with similar parental education. "

The entire process was left to me so I had the freedom to choose what I wanted to do with the data- which added to the fun of it. I do think asking questions about gender bias, ethnicity, parental education etc gave insights into what is really affecting pupil's education. These sort of analyses, I hope, can be used for evidence based decision making which in turn can help students facing difficulties. \n",

I could have written two functions (one for one column and one for 2 columns) calling a set of strings and dataframe and use the column names and dataframe to call other relavant functions for subject results to get the final results. But, I am not sure, at present, I want to try doing the nested functions since we may be covering it later in the course. So I have typed out each column name and looked through their groups. I do see the advantage of using nested functions instead to group them so we can simply supply column names and dataframe to the functions to make things easier in the future - without having to repeat the code for every grouping."
